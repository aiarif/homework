	<h2>HTML TAG</h2>
		<p>The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.
		The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the doctype tag).</p></br>

	<h2>Body Tag</h2>
		<p>The <body> tag defines the document's body.

		The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.</p>

	<h2>Comments Tag</h2>
		<p>The comment tag is used to insert comments in the source code. Comments are not displayed in the browsers.

		You can use comments to explain your code, which can help you when you edit the source code at a later date. This is especially useful if you have a lot of code.</p></br>

	<h2>Lorem Ipsum</h2>
		<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p>

	<h2>Image tag</h2>
		<p>The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.</br>

		Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.</p>

		<img src="image/1.jpg" height="300px" width="400">				
	<h2>Head Tag</h2>
		<p>The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.</br>

		Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.</p><br>
